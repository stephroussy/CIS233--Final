<!-- This is where the paragraph element begins--><p class="hier">Hierarchal organization was the most appropriate kind of site design for the Skatedevils Urban 
    Jungle website. Linear organization would not have been a good site organization for this website because it wasn't a site that required to be looked at 
    sequentially and in a specific order. Random organization was not used either because 
    the Skatedevils Urban Jungle website required some organization that is just not given with the 
    random design. Hierarchal organization allows visitors to be welcomed to a homepage and use that
    webpage to access the other pages linked to it.</p><!-- This is where the paragraph element ends-->
